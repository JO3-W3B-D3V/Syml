# Contributing to Syml
Firstly, thanks for your help! ðŸ˜Ž

The following is a simple set of guidelines that I'd appreciate that you follow if you wish to contribute to the Syml project! 

## Code of Conduct 
When contributing, in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors & maintainers pledge to making participation in our project & our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity & expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
 
 ## How to Contribute?
 Firstly, I'd appreciate it if you were to either create a work item to go into the backlog or create an issue & myself or some other contributor to the project will ensure that it gets handled ASAP.
 
 When contributing, please would you create a branch, while working on that branch, please would you create a PR when you feel that the code you've written is ready to be put into master.
 
 Please would you also ensure that you apply the following:
 
 * Ensure that the work item and/or issue has an appropriate title.
 * If necessary, please provide examples of what you'd like to change or are experiencing at this moment in time. 
 * Include screenshots or GIFs if necessary. 
 * When reporting performance related issues, would you mind simply including either a CPU profile capture or a memory heap snapshot, etc.
* Include information about your environment, OS, browser, IDE, etc.
